# Enhancing-E-Commerce-Strategies-through-Data-Analytics-Power-BI

## Overview

As an analyst at Digital Commerce Insights, I focused on analyzing two critical datasets: 'Ecommerce Orders' and 'Customer Profiles'. These datasets provided valuable insights into customer behavior and demographics. The 'Ecommerce Orders' dataset contains detailed information on customer orders, including products purchased, quantities, prices, order dates, and shipping costs. The 'Customer Profiles' dataset offers comprehensive information on customer demographics, including email, country, membership type, and spending history. These datasets serve as the foundation for understanding customer behavior and optimizing business strategies in the digital commerce domain.

## Objective

Within the dynamic e-commerce landscape, comprehending customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and optimizing order fulfillment stands as paramount. This project aimed to delve into these datasets to unveil underlying patterns and glean insightful observations. By doing so, the overarching objective was to innovate e-commerce strategies, enrich customer engagement, and catalyze sales growth.

2. Open the PowerBI file using PowerBI Desktop.
3. Connect the dashboard to the included datasets ('Ecommerce Orders' and 'Customer Profiles').
4. Refresh the data to ensure the dashboard is up to date with the latest insights.
5. Explore the diverse visualizations and filters to delve into e-commerce performance and discover valuable insights.
